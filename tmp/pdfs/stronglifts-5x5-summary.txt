Stronglifts 5x5 App - Repo Summary

WHAT IT IS
A Garmin Connect IQ watch app named "Stronglifts 5x5" for Forerunner 245 that guides strength sessions on-watch.
It runs a workout-state flow (warmup/rest/work/choice/summary) and stores lift weights between sessions.

WHO IT'S FOR
Primary persona: A lifter using Stronglifts 5x5 who wants to run and log sets directly from a Garmin Forerunner 245.

WHAT IT DOES
- Provides built-in Workout A and Workout B exercise plans with set counts and per-exercise progression increments.
- Alternates workouts across sessions using last workout state.
- Tracks elapsed time per segment with 1-second UI refresh.
- Supports rest/work transitions and per-set effort choice (Easy or Hard).
- Lets users edit current lift weight during rest/work (hold UP, +/- 2.5 kg, save with LAP).
- Persists profile data (last workout and exercise weights) in Application.Storage.
- Creates and saves a Garmin ActivityRecording strength-training session, with lap markers and exit options (Resume/Save/Toss).

HOW IT WORKS (ARCHITECTURE)
- App bootstrap: Stronglifts5x5App creates StrongliftsMainView + StrongliftsInputDelegate.
- Input path: InputDelegate maps hardware keys (LAP/UP/DOWN/BACK, UP hold) to view handlers.
- Control logic: StrongliftsStateMachine owns workout state, timers, cursors, progression, and exit/save/discard behavior.
- Domain logic: StrongliftsWorkoutLogic defines workout templates, alternation helper, and kg formatting.
- Persistence: StrongliftsStorage loads/saves a profile dictionary under key "stronglifts_5x5_profile_v1".
- Data flow: Key event -> state transition -> display model -> view render; save path -> profile update + storage write + activity save.

HOW TO RUN (MINIMAL)
1. Build in project root:
   monkeyc -f monkey.jungle -o bin/Stronglifts5x5.prg -y ~/.ciq/developer_key.der
2. Start Connect IQ Simulator:
   "/Users/johanhargnenohagen/Library/Application Support/Garmin/ConnectIQ/Sdks/connectiq-sdk-mac-8.4.1-2026-02-03-e9f77eeaa/bin/ConnectIQ.app/Contents/MacOS/simulator"
3. Launch app on fr245 simulator target:
   "/Users/johanhargnenohagen/Library/Application Support/Garmin/ConnectIQ/Sdks/connectiq-sdk-mac-8.4.1-2026-02-03-e9f77eeaa/bin/monkeydo" "/Users/johanhargnenohagen/Develop/App/stronglifts-5x5/bin/Stronglifts5x5.prg" fr245
